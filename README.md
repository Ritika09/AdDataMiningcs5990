## **Results two most similar documents according to their cosine similarity**
###### Need to import some files like cosine_similarity, CountVectorizer, textmining
###### For text mining first time users have to install textmining
#### Thoughts ####
* Defined the documents. 
* Used count vectorizer to create a vector for each unique word in our documents. 
* Converting the vector on the DataFrame using pandas. 
* Selected the particular term only to compute cosine similarity 
* Computed cosine similarity 
* Retrieved the heighest cosine matrix and analyzed which two documents are most similar.
